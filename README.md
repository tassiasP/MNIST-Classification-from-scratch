# MNIST-classification
MNIST handwritten digits classification.
A one-hidden-layer Neural Network is built, __without__ using DL libraries.

The implementation of the NN is done in both Python and MATLAB.

A __keras model__ with a simple CNN architecture is also included in order to compare the accuracy with the vanilla models.
